# instructions

1. add .gitignore
2. git init if not done already by the cli
3. git add .
4. git commit -m "first commit"
5. git remote add origin "your repo url"
6. git push --set-upstream origin master (master is your default branch, it can be dev if you want)
7. after that, you only do git add . git commit -m "something" and git push

Got it ?

Can you repeat the add gitignore ?

best if you do it in front of me, and i guide you
it won't take long.
we can on the same project


you did something there in those files to add it right ? thats what i missed

.gitignore is a file that tells git to take all except what it's there, like nodemodules

Add a file called .gitignore (the extension is gitignore, and it has no name)
